### Assistant Professor, Computer Science  
Alfred University, New York

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Alfred University and a researcher 
in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, specializing in unsupervised learning, real-time  
vision systems, and multimodal foundation models. I completed my Ph.D. at Iowa State  
University, where my research focused on scalable computer vision methods for object  
discovery, semantic segmentation, and building footprint reconstruction.

I worked at the intersection of theory and practice through research collaborations with  
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with publications in top-tier venues such as ICLR and  
CVPR and support from NSF-funded projects. My work emphasizes developing robust,  
real-world AI systems, and I actively contribute to the research community as a reviewer  
for leading conferences including ECCV, ICML, and NeurIPS.
