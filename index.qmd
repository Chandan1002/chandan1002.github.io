## Bio

I'm a Computer Scientist working at the intersection of AI/ML, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. 
<!-- I am the author of [Computational Modeling of Infectious Disease](https://computationalinfectiousdisease.com), a richly illustrated compendium on modern computational epidemiology, as well as [a growing body of research](papers). -->

I am currently attending [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) for my Ph.D. (Computer Science). I attended Iowa State University for my Masters of Science (Computer Science), graduating with a distinction (1st class).  Prior to Iowa State, I hold Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) Degree from [B.I.T. Sindri](https://www.bitsindri.ac.in/), India, graduating with a distinction (1st class).
<!-- I also hold degrees from Cardiff and Robert Gordon University Aberdeen, and have studied at the University of Leiden under an Erasmus programme. Today, I am [board certified in public health](https://cph.nbphe.org/employer_letter/19626), a Fellow of the [Royal Society for Public Health](https://www.rsph.org.uk/) and a member of several other learned societies. -->

<!-- I am currently a Practice Directorr at  for Biomedical AI/ML for [HCLTech](https://www.hcltech.com/), where I advise the world's leading life sciences, medical devices and pharma companies on how to leverage AI/ML to improve their products and serve their customers better. I am also a visiting thesis supervisor for students on the data science track of the mathematics programme at the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en). -->

As part of my service to the profession, I've been a reviewer for [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/) and [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), ICML, ECCV . 

You can find a [list of my publications here](papers). 
<!-- My work on COVID-19 has been [featured in the media](media). I also write on various topics as the fancy strikes -- you can peruse my [notebook](blog) here. -->

## Key research interests

-   **Deep Learning**: Unsupervised Learning algorithms, Unsupervised object retrieval.
-   **Computer Vision**: Object Detection.

## Teaching

<!-- I am a visiting thesis supervisor for students on the data science track of the mathematics programme at the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en) - you can read more about this [here](teaching). -->

<!-- From time to time, I get invited to give talks and lectures. My capacity for this is somewhat limited due to other commitments, but if you are interested in having me speak at your event, please [get in touch](mailto:chris+website@chrisvoncsefalvay.com). -->

## Personal life

I currently reside in Ames, IA, USA, though my roots trace back to Bihar, India. During my formative years, I resided in Mussoorie, India, where I pursued my education at Oak Grove School. Since 2017, I have called the United States my home, where I am currently pursuing my studies.

During my leisure hours, I indulge in reading and attempting to cook, albeit with limited success.
<!-- and Renaissance polyphony (esp. Thomas Tallis and Orlando di Lasso). I'm credited for a somewhat pretty sequence of integers called Jellyfish Heart numbers ([OEIS A344856](https://oeis.org/A344856)), which I discovered in 2020 while doing something that has nothing at all to do with my day job. -->

<!-- I live with [neuromyelitis optica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromyelitis_optica) since 2015, which has left me with a lifelong desire to understand complex, multicausal health conditions like NMOSD better. -->
