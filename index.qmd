## Bio

As a Computer Vision and Deep Learning researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I work at the intersection of unsupervised learning and computer vision, specializing in building footprint reconstruction and multimodal foundation models. My research, published in top-tier venues like ICLR and CVPR, focuses on developing innovative solutions in unsupervised object detection and real-time vision systems.
With NSF-funded research and industry recognition including the President's Award at John Deere, I bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical applications. Currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Iowa State University, I contribute to groundbreaking projects across national laboratories while serving as a reviewer for prestigious conferences including ECCV, ICML, and NeurIPS.
I specialize in developing scalable solutions that push the boundaries of computer vision and deep learning, with particular expertise in:

- Unsupervised learning algorithms for object detection and discovery
- Real-time computer vision systems for edge computing
- Multi-modal foundation models for earth observation
- Semantic segmentation and building footprint reconstruction 

<!-- I am the author of [Computational Modeling of Infectious Disease](https://computationalinfectiousdisease.com), a richly illustrated compendium on modern computational epidemiology, as well as [a growing body of research](papers). -->

<!-- I am currently attending [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) for my Ph.D. (Computer Science). I attended Iowa State University for my Masters of Science (Computer Science), graduating with a distinction (1st class). Prior to Iowa State, I hold Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) Degree from [B.I.T. Sindri](https://www.bitsindri.ac.in/), India, graduating with a distinction (1st class). <!-- I also hold degrees from Cardiff and Robert Gordon University Aberdeen, and have studied at the University of Leiden under an Erasmus programme. Today, I am [board certified in public health](https://cph.nbphe.org/employer_letter/19626), a Fellow of the [Royal Society for Public Health](https://www.rsph.org.uk/) and a member of several other learned societies. --> -->

<!-- I am currently a Practice Directorr at  for Biomedical AI/ML for [HCLTech](https://www.hcltech.com/), where I advise the world's leading life sciences, medical devices and pharma companies on how to leverage AI/ML to improve their products and serve their customers better. I am also a visiting thesis supervisor for students on the data science track of the mathematics programme at the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en). -->

As part of my service to the profession, I've been a reviewer for [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/) and [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), ICML, ECCV .

You can find a [list of my publications here](papers). <!-- My work on COVID-19 has been [featured in the media](media). I also write on various topics as the fancy strikes -- you can peruse my [notebook](blog) here. -->

## Personal life

I currently reside in Ames, IA, USA, though my roots trace back to Bihar, India. During my formative years, I resided in Mussoorie, India, where I pursued my education at Oak Grove School. Since 2017, I have called the United States my home, where I am currently pursuing my studies.

During my leisure hours, I indulge in reading and attempting to cook, albeit with limited success. <!-- and Renaissance polyphony (esp. Thomas Tallis and Orlando di Lasso). I'm credited for a somewhat pretty sequence of integers called Jellyfish Heart numbers ([OEIS A344856](https://oeis.org/A344856)), which I discovered in 2020 while doing something that has nothing at all to do with my day job. -->

<!-- I live with [neuromyelitis optica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromyelitis_optica) since 2015, which has left me with a lifelong desire to understand complex, multicausal health conditions like NMOSD better. -->
